# Cancer Detection Model

This repository contains code for a machine learning model designed for cancer detection. The model utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict whether a given sample is indicative of cancer or not.

## Overview

Early detection of cancer is crucial for successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. Machine learning models offer a promising approach to aid in the early detection process by analyzing various features extracted from medical samples to classify them as cancerous or non-cancerous.

This repository provides an implementation of a cancer detection model using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

## Features

- Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps including normalization, feature scaling, and handling missing values.
- Model Selection: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- Evaluation: Model evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
- Deployment: Instructions for deploying the trained model in production environments.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing features extracted from medical samples. The dataset comprises both cancerous and non-cancerous samples, with each sample represented by a set of features such as cell characteristics, genetic markers, etc.
